title: Mornings Like These
---
These morning are like stale coffee;</br> 
the numbing, wet asphalt.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every frozen piece of metal railing,<br/>
seems like such a bone-breaking and jerky<br/>
awakening.<br/>
The silence yelling like a prison-cell inmate,<br/>
churring every ounce of warmth <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the embattled street lamps.<br/>
<br/>
At several points, the sidewalk cracks, black with<br/>
gum stains.<br/>
dead leaves pitter-pattered through the soggy <br/>
mosh pits of sewer water.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raging brown dirt constrasts the white paint,<br/>
faced out on the walls.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two shrinking shadows. 
That ugly American Apparel billboard.<br/>
Sumatriptan kind of sunrise. Soggy toast. <br/>
Bike racks emptied by the maintenance man.<br/>
<br/>
Dreary old drunk sputtering his steps: two paces forward.<br/>
One back.<br/>
Each crufty oak branch begrimed in between bus stop benches.<br/>
With a sulky, hoary Russian woman and two little fury eyes.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood shot irises, strung-hung like a crucifier.<br/>
This crucible of miseries and wilted petals--brown, never white.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always tired, sleepers in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Mornings like these must swallow those pain killers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pill bottles. Dusty bricks. Grumpy-looking paint cans.<br/>
Like the devil himself won't even wake up this early.<br/>
Like no one except the resentful sun ever gets up.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the whip cracks down upon time itself.<br/>
