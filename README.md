# About the site

I figure since Github Pages makes this free and easy, why not make this a space to share ideas. It's been a blank page for way to long, so it's finally time to start jotting down some thoughts. 

This will mainly be a space to write down thoughts I have about technology and really anything that I currently find interesting.
