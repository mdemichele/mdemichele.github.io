title: The twitches
---
The left side of my face twitches<br/>
whenever creativity strikes,<br/>
I feel a certain sickness.<br/>
My eyes get blurry.<br/>
My fingers start to numb.<br/>
The sinews in my palms sweat uncontrollably,<br/>
Unconsolably, my body won't cooperate.<br/>
I can't think straight,<br/>
sideways, angles always trip inside my brain<br/>
as if the rules of logic dance<br/>
back and forth,<br/>
twisting,<br/>
in my soul, sided, seed-brained<br/>
mentality of all that remains<br/>
of intelligibility.<br/>
