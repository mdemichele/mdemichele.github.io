title: "Simple Thoughts"

I've been spending a lot of time lately thinking about simplicity as a feature rather than a bug. I've always been attracted to things that ooze simplicity. These types of things aren't the ones that jump out at you, or at least, they aren't the types of things that <em>want</em> to jump out at you. 

Simple things are beautiful. Trees swaying in the wind. Open desert, filled with silent and stationary cacti. Blank canvases, empty and waiting for creativity. Small type on large empty pages. 

Simplicity is beautiful, and it doesn't need you to acknowledge it. Simple things are beautiful because it's in their nature. 

Things that are loud and attention-grabbing need to try newer and louder tactics to hold your attention. Attention is fleeting, so the things that cater to attention need to be ever-protective of that fleeting asset. 

But the things that are simple remain relevant because they are beautiful in their nature. They aren't beautiful because some crowd of half-attentive consumers have dubbed it as such; they're beautiful because they just are. That's the essence of simplicity. 

Simplicity isn't the norm in the world we live in today. In my everyday life, I feel constantly bombarded by noise, by loud screens, by FOMO, by every advertisement that screams at me throughout the day. In today's world, simplicity feels that much more different. 

Simplicity welcomes. 
It invites. 
It makes space where there was none.
