title: These Afternoons
---
These afternoons, with skies sometimes blue,<br/> 
sometimes squally.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always steeped with dry, frigid air.<br/>
Peering outside through the big prism of a window,<br/>
sitting silently behind my white desk, with white hands.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always smiling. Looking. Beaming like the pastor at church today.<br/>

These middle passive kind of days. Something kind of like watery oatmeal.<br/>
Forced-in sentiments, asked politely to hold her keys for her.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I get a visitor's pass, please?"<br/>
Mary, Carmen, Ju Sung, Gangwish.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was your name again?"<br/>
Nothing to take offense at, just disintrest told honestly.<br/>
