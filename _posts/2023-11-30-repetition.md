These feelings roll down my tongue<br/>
like bourbon, bitter until the third glass.<br/>
insipid as the day-old coffee ground,<br/>
mulching inside the dirty mugs, unwashed in the sink.<br/>

Heavy, like second-hand cigarette smoke,<br/>
the kind that lingers around the bar stools,<br/>
bloodshot and tired, the regulars are always loud.<br/>

So much laughter, squeezed from ashy lungs.<br/>
Sniffling noses and beady eyes.<br/>
The girls drooping down the stairs like the hot breeze.<br/>
In and out, and always back again.<br/>

Repetition for the hopeless types,<br/>
bleeding fingers caught in bathroom doorways.<br/>
The bleary pacing across the gum-shot pavement, <br/>
hoping to wash out the beer stains before the sun <br/>
goes back to work.<br/>
